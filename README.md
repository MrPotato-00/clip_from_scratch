# clip_from_scratch

This project aims to explore implementation of Clip from scratch with its incredible features of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval. Make sure cuda pytorch with cuda is already installed in your system (although pytorch with cuda will be installed in this implementation within the virtual environment). A detailed explanation of the implementation will be soon available in a medium article.

Steps for implementing this implementation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install the dependencies. (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Run the training script. (python3 main.py)
5. Run the retrieval script while passing argument in command line.
